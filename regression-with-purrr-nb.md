Regression with purrr
================

In portfolio analysis, often times we are required to regress
instruments against a benchmark or reference index. In this short and
simple example, we explore how we could tackle this use-case of
obtaining the beta coefficient of several indexes against a benchmark.

Taking a look at the dataset. As observed there are four indexes across
various sectors and a `Market` benchmark.

``` r
indexes <- data.table::fread("temp/indexes.csv")
head(indexes)
```

    ##           id       date         return
    ## 1: Utilities 2002-01-01  0.00003519062
    ## 2: Utilities 2002-01-02  0.00448078073
    ## 3: Utilities 2002-01-03 -0.00143632860

    ## 5: Utilities 2002-01-05  0.00000000000
    ## 6: Utilities 2002-01-06  0.00000000000

``` r
unique(indexes$id)
```

Traditionally, one might run a loop to pair each index against the
benchmark for a linear regression.

Below is an example how one might use the *split-apply-combine*
technique often used in other instances of data wrangling.

Because the operation weâ€™re doing is to obtain a linear regression
model, this task is not so easily solved with a `group_by()` method.

``` r
#Reshape so Market is in one column, the rest in another column. 
#This is so that we can regress all indexes against Market respectively and extract the model stats.
indexes.long <- indexes %>%
  filter(date >= ymd(20110101), date <= ymd(20191231)) %>%
  distinct %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "id", values_from = "return") %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "index", values_to = "return", cols = -c("Market", "date"))

#Perform regression against ACWI -------------
models <- indexes.long %>%
  #Here's the equivalent of a group_by() with purrr
  split(.$index) %>%
  map(~lm(return ~ Market, data = .))

#Extract the beta of each index
models %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  #The beta coefficient we're looking for is in the second element
  map_dfr(~.$coefficients[2])
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 4
    ##   Airlines Banks Biotech Utilities
    ##      <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.975  1.13   0.986     0.655

And there you have it\! This is definitely more readable than a loop and
neater for extracting the beta coefficient quickly.

``` r
sessionInfo()
```
